    <h2>HEDGEHOGS AS PETS!</h2>

    <h4>The hedgehog has also found a place in many people’s homes because there is no other pet quite like this.</h4>

    <p>The <em>African Pygmy hedgehog</em> is the most commonly kept hedgehog as a pet. Hedgehogs have a few characteristics that you should be aware of if you are planning on having one as a pet. First, they are nocturnal. This means that their natural time to sleep is during the day, and they will be more active into the evening and night. They may make noises such as grunts, snuffles, and sometimes screams that could interrupt your sleep should they be near your bedroom and you are a light sleeper. Additionally, they are omnivores so basically they need to eat both meats and fruits/vegetables to get the necessary nutrients to thrive. Thus, it is likely very difficult to make a diet that will always satisfy these needs, and any animal can get very sick if they are missing an important part of their diet. It is important to either get a commercially available food or do proper research and discuss this with your exotic animal veterinarian. Lastly, though this may seem obvious to some, hedgehogs are <strong>NOT</strong> cuddly. People may be thrown off by their cute face and inquisitive nature but they are not lap pets meant to be petted like a cat. The main reason for this is that they have spines! The entire body of the hedgehog is covered by these spines, except for their underside. They are not barbed so if they get stuck in your flesh they are easy to remove and not as painful as porcupine quills, but they still hurt. When a hedgehog is scared or threatened it will roll into a ball exposing its spines. This is definitely not a ball that you want to play catch with!</p>
